# C Custom Connectors


Please import JDFBadboyConnector unamanaged solution first and then JDFBadboyConnectorFlow solution 2nd.


##What is in this then ?

Well, some custom C# connectors, that execute C# code.  There are 7 as of 11/10/2024

1. Calculate Age from Date of Birth
2. Calculate Days Between Two Dates
3. Calculate Distance Between Two Coordinates
4. Generate a random string
5. Number To Text
6. Text Reversal
7. Validate Email Address

Each one has it's own unique OperationID, and this is then passed along with the parameters required as a JSON object with the C# code to produce an output.

There is a Power Automate cloud flow as part of the second solution import, and this gives you an example of all of the runs of each of the C# custom code elements.
